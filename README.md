FactionsXL is a Minecraft server mod that combines the features of a few popular standalone games and the classic, well-known factions game type.

The visual appearance of FXL and the command syntax are designed to be similar to [FactionsOne](https://github.com/DRE2N/FactionsOne) so that players feel familiar with it at least if they have already made experiences with Factions.

## Compatibility
### Server
FactionsXL requires Spigot 1.13.2-1.15.2 to work. 
### Building information and dependencies
Building FactionsXL from source requires [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Maven automatically fetches all dependencies and builds FactionsXL; just run _build.bat_ or enter the command _mvn clean install_.

#### DRECommons
[DRECommons](https://github.com/DRE2N/DRECommons) is a util library for common tasks. FactionsXL contains DRECommons.

### Java
Make sure that your server uses Java 8 or higher.

### Known incompatibilities
_None so far._
